In much of the world, being a young student from a low-income background often means no access to quality education, and the life-changing opportunities that come with it. 

Most emerging economies of Africa, South America and Asia, see free quality education administered by few institutions with limited places and competitive entry requirements. The backbone of the education system is made up by a plethora of private high schools and colleges which, while not always offering prohibitive fees, often provide poor value for money in terms of learning experience and employment prospects after graduation.

The few institutions that do offer sufficiently high standards tend to be on top of the tuition ladder, as well as being located in the national capitals or tier-1 cities. This poses a twin challenge for low-income students hailing from provincial or rural areas, who need to be able to afford both the cost of tuition and that of urban living.

The gap in educational standards between public and private schools, big city and small town schools, is deep-rooted in the history of these societies and is neither easy nor quick to fix.

What one can more easily improve are the chances for deserving students to access quality education regardless of socio-economic conditions or geographical location, gender or creed. Few investments are farther-reaching than helping young minds achieve their potential, fulfil their aspirations. Today's bright students are tomorrow's leaders, agents of progress and growth for the families, communities, societies they will be called to serve.

These promising students need capital to pay for their studies. So why not raise it by creating a tradable instrument that tracks both a student's present value and their expectations of future success, based on objective metrics not dissimilar from those governing the equity markets?

Why, then, not leverage Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and offer such an instrument as a Non-fungible Token (NFT) to the wider public? This way, anybody may crowdfund a student's success while enjoying the combined growth effects of free-market floating and a predictable inflation model linked to the student's ongoing progress.

# Mechanics

1. Bootstrap stage. Student, or an Agent on their behalf, will need to build a Pledge, a collection of materials that establish the student's performance up to that point: verified transcripts from past and current educational institutions, references from education professionals, friends and family, proof of low-income status, etc. All this materials will be vetted and, after being deemed genuine, cryptographically secured and stored in the Ethereum L1 or L2 blockchain.

2. Token creation stage. Student, or an Agent on their behalf, will proceed creating their personal NFT, aptly parcelized in 1M units. The Pledge and all its attached materials are made public on a website and may, at any time, be proved genuine by verifying the blockchain record. By default, the base value of the NFT may be set at a symbolic amount, e.g. 1 ETH, or about 3,000 USD.

3. Seeding stage. The NFT will enter the market via a specialised exchange and made available to the wider public. Investors may access all Pledges and make a judgment call on each Students' present and expected future value. Based on this judgment, they may opt to buy one or more Student Tokens, at a price that increases geometrically based on fractional units bought. To avoid abuse, a limit may be placed on how much fractional units may be bought by a single address.

E.g baseline price is 1 ETH, or 0.000001 ETH per unit. Order have a minimum size of 1%, or 10,000 units. Every 1% (10,000 units) bought will automatically inflate the price by   2.4%. This corresponds to the Student Token price being 400% of baseline value, or the equivalent of 10/14K USD, when all units are boughts.

4. Fruition stage. After a pre-determined number of days from token creation, the Investment stage will be deemed concluded. E.g. assuming 75% of the Token is bought, the market price of the token is fixed at the 76th percentile, so 0.05922386522 ETH for 10,000 units (from a baseline of 0.01).

The value of the sold token units would be 2.11 ETH. Student may be able to access up to 50% of the pool every year (assuming a 4-year degree). So they will be able to liquidate up to 1.055 ETH = 3,165 USD to cover their education costs for their first year.

5. Free market stage. Following Seeding stage, the remaining units of the Student Token will be free to float on the market, from their initial price of 0.05922386522 ETH per 10,000 units. Early investors will be able to immediately realise gains up to around 578% of their initial investment. Minimum lot size will move from 10,000 units to something much lower, e.g. 100 units, at a price of 0.0005922386522 ETH.

6. Inflation stage. Following Seeding stage, the inflation model will start functioning, allowing the Student Token to track the Student's performance over time. The inflation model may for instance track the number of credits/units earned towards the Student's degree. E.g. for 20 credits per year, every credit may inflate the token price by 1%. To incentivise Student to excel, inflation percentage may be made to vary based on grade, e.g. an "A+" (80% and above) will carry a full 1%, while a "B" only 0.25%.

The model may be tweaked to reflect specific biases on degree subjects (e.g. STEM preferred over Humanities and Liberal studies), academic entrance requirements (e.g. "harder" colleges will inflate the price more). Credentials proving successfully-earned credits will have to be verified by an independent Agent and recorded on the blockchain, and associated with the inflation factor applied.

# Notes

The Student Token is not a loan. It is the equivalent of generating equity based on the "market fundamentals" of excellent academic performance.

Privacy considerations are important: Pledges may be made public without necessarily disclosing the Student's gender, name, address and other generalities. This is of paramount importance as many Students may be minors at the time of joining the programme. The only proof Investors, in fact any participant, will require is that all initial and ongoing credentials establishing academic performance is genuine.

If the independent Agent model is not possible, a private company overseeing the programme will be created. In this case, an administrative fee (e.g. 1% of the token value per year) will be levied.
